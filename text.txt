09f8bb6959f70edaf90d7d852e2ca9c85d2bf06a Added missing newlines. Clarified that for the assignment-2 one may work with local repositories, and that there's absolutely no necessity to use external APIs or libraries, and such.
bb60038d09c28d4d7749d15b6a8da6726e40163c List of assignments for the rest of the semester!
7e3661d85587bcd346bbbedbce57f4bfc0cb827d The first version: converting series of headers to a row in a big table. Each row is for now represented by a Python dictionary. Need to write this to a simple text table so we can import it as a DataFrame in Pandas.
53e8068c3d163e14f0992c9eeadd2c1495f74aa8 Changed the string used to separate each header block. Using a shorter one reduces the file size by a substantial amount.
7e26655675b51b9d9cf21f6c89eafee53aeff3d7 Rough cut of the mktabl program. Incomplete, in the sense that headers spanning multiple lines are not handled. Otherwise, produces correct output for one line header-lines. Needs some more work.
b215c69b0feae19f4fe5ed825c9298000ba10fe4 Ported the solution to Python 3.5.2, and ensured that everything is compatible with 2.7.x.
350545f1e22777ee83078b251bbfeeab41cd1508 Fixed an important bug! 'gmr.py' was eating initial two letters from the name of the recipient!
99ffb7ad1c0b09c77cb45beb4e71b55a4c029e20 Dot plot and a stacked-dot plot of US ozone concentration in the air.
2b261d94c2a02ed1b6407e89c959063810cb2e58 The text version of the FBI data.
03873504756f28403119a3ab8aa12ebfa60b08a0 Changed the way we plot values. The values are plotted in the ascending order. Y axis ticks are also labeled per the ascending order.
0d8b48e564f842de6ef8b63d0a3c060ab4378be1 A quick and dirty way to sort on frequency of emails sent/recieved and print the result. Uses some simple tricks to elide email ids, etc.
635bd78f141c7eec7b5ff634cbe12ad0dee8840e Fixed a rendering bug. The first offense ('murder') was not appearing on the y-axis. Fixed it by properly setting  the y-axis limits and ticks linearly spaced.
a8f37253673877849c674e195588ad95a971065a for the first time drew custom axis spines with labels.
ca8fd729cefecc755b2814af0de7dc3a0e2fbbff Gender crime pattern. Plotted the graph of data from 2014.
e959752c70751e2183527e24bd78e1896d93a2ff The amazing science of computing quantile and plotting them!
cece540487ca1d6b7d110aa2fc9f9b42b67874a1 Added examples to develop the mental-model of dataframes.
192de5176e420c2646c9e3b012e868bfa1a6a3d2 A bunch of code snippets that help build a mental-model of matplotlib basics.
642a14d8f13714761dddd8722e600f9b7e00791f Made data transformation explicit. Added a few comments.
4d350e48393b56eba6c71cee9a13750c3f415ed7 Used a better name for the variable: changed vline to hline. Changed the default to draw plot on the screen rather than save images.
0f5c1a20b45cb30478c1b61ea84e35f4349a225d Google GMail archive scanners. Collect simple data - senders and receiver frequencies.
47229dfba425754a8bcddb61df3fcf2dac3a5aca Refactored the code. The figure background is set to white color.
1a30cc9fd11ad6af5a539796fe905f44a049c8d6 How to draw an interval graph?
82ace57057a8bc1d73d39ce6c5a02a7553286e85 Renamed source file: make-data --> make_data. I was passing an array of array of indices in make_stat.py. Changed it to an array of indices.
4a5181507fc13d3f628bdc824f3f14ea39e3ee62 Lecture slide deck for grammar of graphics data and variables.
59c46f0d3c16f76e314e195aae57fb5739e42e70 Created a table of statistics. Fixed import bug in the 'read_data' program.
badf39366f42e08cf3663dd2b3f52d224c69c1c8 Read in the data - pandas.DataFrame.
0cfdc3b655746297c197404d8d6016fc75964547 A cool program to create csv files containing the responses of men and women.
61d1f82bab8fd060cb7f2a52e416e440349f78e9 Slide deck: Introduction to Grammar of Graphics. Life of Tukey + Tukey: Future of Data Analysis + Brief History of S.
f9d311cf20ac428d495733629ad0928caf406553 Added (1)Chartjunk debate and (2)Interactive analytics; both by Stephen Few.
f19b7a661504a7a1908fc961a798070b1eacb273 Added an interesting paper titled 'Ten Simple Rules for Better Visualization' by Nicolas Rougier and others.
f7a56ae6bda8e8f664e89baac701ef48b6f535d0 Initial commit.
